# hashhub

## Project Description
hashhub is a decentralized project management smart contract built on Ethereum. It allows users to create, update, and view project details on the blockchain in a secure and transparent way.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to build a decentralized platform where project ownership and details are immutable and easily accessible, reducing dependency on centralized systems and increasing trust within project communities.

## Key Features
- **Create Projects:** Any user can create a new project with a name and description.
- **Update Projects:** Project creators can update project information or deactivate projects.
- **View Projects:** Anyone can fetch project details by project ID.

## Future Scope
- Integrate role-based access controls for multiple collaborators.
- Add project funding and milestone tracking.
- Build a frontend UI to interact with the smart contract.
- Support for NFT-based project ownership certificates.
